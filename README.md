# Car Dheko - Used Car Price Prediction
I developed a machine learning model to predict used car prices for Car Dheko. The project involved data cleaning, feature engineering, and training models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. I evaluated models using MAE, MSE, and R-squared, optimizing them through cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning. The best model was deployed using Streamlit, creating an interactive web app where users can input car details and get instant price predictions. The project enhanced customer experience and streamlined pricing for sales teams.
